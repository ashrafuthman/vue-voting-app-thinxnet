## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

```
* I Could not work more on it since I am super busy with my current job and I already have a deadline with this task

A lot of things could be improved and I know how to improve them since I already have experiece with that.
For example:
- Access the store with mapgetters and mapactions
- VueX can be replaced with Composition API in this scenario
- Also tests can be wrote on top of the functions

* When it comes to unvote, it should work when you attempt to vote and unvote one time only because the API that I created does not behave correctly on Heroku so it is not frontend issue but backend.

Hope I will be able to pass!
